We are a R1 research institution and students with a strong STEM curriculum that includes research or lab work are generally more competitive in our applicant pool and more success as students at Binghamton because of their early HS experience.” Towson University: “Participation in this program would show us that the student is challenging him/herself in their courses which is something we look at when reviewing applications.” Drew University: “Yes,it would show that they are challenging themselves in the classroom.” NJIT: “Yes- this would demonstrate to Admissions that a student is interested in STEM programs, and would be a strong candidate for our programs.” Ithaca College: “Yes, we look for students who participate in classes and activities that enhance their knowledge and skills in their area of interest.” Montclair University: “Rigorous math and science lab classes beyond standard curriculum could be looked at for scholarship eligibility along with high GPA.”",
